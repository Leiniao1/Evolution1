Line7~Line15: Environment: Just List the Environment it fits. For the rest space type anything

Line16~Line20: Special Ability
         
Line20~Line25: Labels (Including 1 of the 10), and any other labels:

	5, shell (include crab and big shrimp)
	6, fish (include octopus)
	7, amphibian

All Below: Eat what:
        You can put the following label or even latin name of the animal, at least 1 "O" even if it doesn't eat anything

Suggested: if you want to leave a space line, type "Void" for environment, type "No" for special ability
	type "X" for Labels, type "O" for Eat Labels


All labels needed to take care:
1, Shrimp (Because Venus's Flower Basket preys them)
2, Sponge (I already used to label, but may not be targeted)
3, Jellyfish (Can not belong to anything but just jellyfish)
